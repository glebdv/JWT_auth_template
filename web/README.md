<b>Create new graphql query/mutation</b>

- create the query/mutation in graphql folder (must match backend ofc)
- run `yarn gen` in the console
- click on `generated/graphql.tsx` to insure that the code has been updated
- wait for TS to kick in and you'll have autocompletion

<b><u>TO CONSIDER:</u></b>

`immer npm` as a way to mutate deeply nested objects in graphql (if need be)
